"""
Common GPU helpers shared between CUDA extensions and the core package.

The actual kernels live in extension packages (e.g. `SHTnsKitCUDAExt`). This
file provides light-weight abstractions that can be referenced from both the
base CPU implementation and GPU-specific extensions without creating load-time
coupling.
