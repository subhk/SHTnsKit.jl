    Plm_row!(P::AbstractVector{T}, x::T, lmax::Int, m::Int) where {T<:Real}

Compute associated Legendre polynomials P_l^m(x) for all degrees l = 0..lmax at fixed order m.

This function implements the stable three-term recurrence relations for associated 
Legendre polynomials. The algorithm follows the Ferrers definition with the 
Condon-Shortley phase factor (-1)^m included, which is standard in physics.

The input x = cos(θ) where θ is the colatitude angle.
Results are stored as P[l+1] = P_l^m(x) for l = 0..lmax (1-based indexing).

    Plm_and_dPdx_row!(P, dPdx, x, lmax, m)

Simultaneously compute associated Legendre polynomials P_l^m(x) and their derivatives.

This function efficiently computes both P_l^m(x) and dP_l^m/dx for all degrees
l = m..lmax at fixed order m. The derivatives are computed with respect to the
argument x = cos(θ), not with respect to the angle θ itself.

The derivative calculation uses the standard recurrence relation:
dP_l^m/dx = [l*x*P_l^m - (l+m)*P_{l-1}^m] / (x²-1)

This is essential for computing gradients and differential operators on the sphere.

"""
    Nlm_table(lmax::Int, mmax::Int)

Precompute normalization factors for orthonormal spherical harmonics.

The normalization ensures that the spherical harmonics form an orthonormal basis:
∫ Y_l^m(θ,φ) [Y_{l'}^{m'}(θ,φ)]* dΩ = δ_{ll'} δ_{mm'}

The normalization factor is:
N_{l,m} = sqrt[(2l+1)/(4π) * (l-m)!/(l+m)!]

This function computes all factors for 0≤m≤mmax, m≤l≤lmax using stable
logarithmic arithmetic to avoid factorial overflow.

Returns matrix N[l+1,m+1] with 1-based indexing.
