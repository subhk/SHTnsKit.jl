# Distributed Computing

Use MPI when a field, a batch, or its spectral coefficients no longer fit
comfortably on one process. For small single fields, serial plans or a GPU are
usually simpler and may be faster.

## Install

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(["MPI", "PencilArrays", "PencilFFTs"])
```

MPI.jl can use its bundled MPI or a system installation. Configure the MPI.jl
backend first, then use its matching launcher.

## Scalar roundtrip

This complete program distributes latitude, transforms a band-limited field,
and checks the largest error across all ranks:

```julia
using MPI
MPI.Init()

using PencilArrays, PencilFFTs, SHTnsKit

comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
cfg = create_gauss_config(64, 66; nlon=129)

# create_spatial_pencil decomposes latitude, the scalable spatial dimension.
pencil = create_spatial_pencil(cfg; comm)
field = PencilArray(
    pencil,
    zeros(Float64, PencilArrays.size_local(pencil)...),
)

local_field = parent(field)
ranges = PencilArrays.range_local(pencil)
for (i_local, i_global) in enumerate(ranges[1]),
    (j_local, j_global) in enumerate(ranges[2])
    x = cfg.x[i_global]
    local_field[i_local, j_local] = 1 + 0.25 * (3x^2 - 1)
end

coefficients = dist_analysis(cfg, field)
recovered = dist_synthesis(
    cfg, coefficients; prototype_θφ=field, real_output=true
)

local_error = maximum(abs, parent(recovered) - local_field)
global_error = MPI.Allreduce(local_error, MPI.MAX, comm)
global_error < 1e-10 || error("roundtrip error: $global_error")

MPI.Comm_rank(comm) == 0 && println("roundtrip error: $global_error")
MPI.Finalize()
```

Save it as `roundtrip_mpi.jl` and run:

```bash
mpiexec -n 2 julia --project=. roundtrip_mpi.jl
```

All ranks must enter distributed operations collectively and construct the
same configuration.

## Choose the spectral layout

SHTnsKit offers two useful layouts:

| Workflow | Spectral result | Choose it when… |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `dist_analysis` / `dist_synthesis` | dense coefficients replicated on every rank | global spectral access and simpler post-processing matter most |
| `DistTransposePlan` | coefficients distributed by order `m` | spectral memory or communication dominates at larger rank counts |

A transpose plan also batches a local third dimension such as radial levels:

```julia
plan = DistTransposePlan(cfg; comm=comm, nlev=8, use_rfft=true)
spatial = allocate_spatial(plan)
spectral = allocate_spectral(plan)

# Fill parent(spatial), then transform collectively.
dist_analysis!(plan, spectral, spatial)
dist_synthesis!(plan, spatial, spectral)
```

Use `dist_analysis_sphtor` / `dist_synthesis_sphtor` for tangential vectors and
the `dist_*_qst` family for three-component fields. Their planned counterparts
follow the same output-before-input convention as serial in-place transforms.

## Practical rules

- Decompose latitude with `create_spatial_pencil`; a longitude-split
  input requires expensive gathering.
- Pass a spatial prototype to allocating synthesis so the result uses the
  intended distribution and storage type.
- Reuse plans for repeated transforms and batch fields that share a grid.
- Measure the slowest rank after warmup, including the communication your real
  workflow performs.
- Keep distributed data distributed between operations; avoid gathering only
  to scatter again.
