"""
SHTns-compatible layout utilities: mode counting and index mapping.

These functions handle the conversion between 2D (l,m) spherical harmonic indices
and 1D packed array indices used by SHTns. This is crucial for efficient memory
layout and compatibility with the underlying C library.

All functions assume non-negative orders `m` that are multiples of `mres`.

"""
    nlm_calc(lmax::Integer, mmax::Integer, mres::Integer) -> Int

Calculate the total number of packed spectral coefficients for a real scalar field.
Real fields only need m ≥ 0 modes due to Hermitian symmetry: Y_l^{-m} = (-1)^m (Y_l^m)*

The packing scheme groups modes by m-order, then by l-degree within each m block.
This layout is optimized for vectorized operations and cache efficiency.

    nlm_cplx_calc(lmax::Integer, mmax::Integer, mres::Integer) -> Int

Calculate the total number of spectral coefficients for a complex field.
Complex fields require both positive and negative m modes, unlike real fields
which use Hermitian symmetry to store only m ≥ 0 modes.

This is used for complex-valued spherical harmonic expansions where no
symmetry assumptions can be made about the coefficients.

    LM_index(lmax::Int, mres::Int, l::Int, m::Int) -> Int

Convert 2D spherical harmonic indices (l,m) to a 1D packed array index.
This implements the SHTns packing convention for efficient memory layout.

The packing scheme groups coefficients by m-order blocks, with each block
containing all valid l-degrees for that m. This enables vectorized operations
on modes with the same azimuthal symmetry.
